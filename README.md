# Repository for CS-205 course at Swansea University

## Coursework Brief Summary:
In this coursework, we were expected to write programs in Haskell to solve some simple tasks as an introduction to functional programming
## Repository Structure:
* Group101.hs: File that includes solutions for most of the coursework
* Q4.hs: File that contains solution for question 4 which required taking user input and therefore much more code than the other questions
